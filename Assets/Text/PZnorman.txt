Huh, this
book is
just a
well
disguised
safe! It
takes two
3-digit
combos,
A and B.

There's a
note...

"A hint
for A
is in
plain sight,
though not
black or
white, to
one side of
this long
paper trail."

"A hint
for B
is a key
with a
picture
of me; a
red and
white
identity.
(Only mine
will work,
please
don't
scan
yours.)"

Solve A
<barcode>A
Solve B
<barcode>B
